Digital privacy has become a top priority for individuals and businesses alike. From financial statements to legal contracts, the documents we share often contain sensitive information that should not fall into the wrong hands.

## The Case for PDF Protection

The PDF format is the industry standard for document sharing precisely because of its versatility and security features. Password protection is the most effective way to ensure that only intended recipients can access your content.

### Why You Should Encrypt Your PDFs

- **Confidentiality**: Ensure that only those with the password can view the content.
- **Control**: Prevent unauthorized printing, copying, or editing of your documents.
- **Compliance**: For businesses, protecting client data is often a legal requirement (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## How to Choose a Strong Password

A lock is only as good as its key. When securing your documents, follow these best practices:

1. **Combine Characters**: Use a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. **Length Matters**: Aim for at least 12 characters.
3. **Avoid the Obvious**: Don't use your name, birthdate, or "password123".
