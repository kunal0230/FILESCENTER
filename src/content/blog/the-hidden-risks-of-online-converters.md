The internet is littered with "Free Online Converter" websites. Type "convert docx to pdf" into Google, and you'll face a wall of ads, pop-ups, and promises of instant results.

But have you ever wondered how these sites pay for their servers? Hosting massive file processing clusters is expensive. Storage costs money. Bandwidth costs money.

If they aren't charging you a subscription, how do they survive?

## 1. The Data Mining Model

The most common model is data harvesting. While many sites claim to "delete files after 24 hours," their Terms of Service often tell a different story. Many reserve the right to "analyze" files for "product improvement."

In the age of AI training, a massive dataset of real-world documents is gold. Your essays, cover letters, and reports could be training the next generation of LLMs.

## 2. The Malware Vector

Some less reputable conversion sites use the "download" step as an attack vector.

- You upload a clean PDF.
- The site converts it.
- You download the result.
- The result contains a malicious macro or is bundled with an executable "downloader."

This is a classic "drive-by" infection technique, targeted specifically at users looking for quick utilities.

## 3. The "Freemium" Trap

This is the most benign but annoying model. The tool works for 1 file, but fails on the second unless you create an account, give them your email, and eventually pay $9/month.

## The FilesCenter Philosophy

We built FilesCenter because we were tired of these risks. We wanted a toolset that:

1. **Never asks for a login.**
2. **Never sees your files.**
3. **Never limits your usage.**

We achieve this by having **no backend costs**. Because your computer does the work, we don't pay for processing power. This allows us to offer these tools for free, forever, without needing to sell your data to cover our bills.

It's a sustainable model based on efficient engineering, not user exploitation.
